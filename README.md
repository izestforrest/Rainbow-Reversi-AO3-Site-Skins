### How to View
Each skin has its own folder, above this README file. Inside each folder, each skin has its own README with palette swatches and (eventually) preview images. As I upload, I will also link the skin folders in the checklist below. The code you need to copy/paste will be in its own file, titled "COPYME".
> [!TIP]
> Github has an easy copy-paste feature. When viewing code, check the menus at the top of the textbox for "Copy" or "Copy Raw File"

### Skins included in this project:
- [x] [Reversi Base](https://github.com/izestforrest/Rainbow-Reversi-AO3-Site-Skins/tree/main/Reversi%20Base/README_og.md)
    - This is the original Reversi color palette, but includes my personalizations in the CSS. Most of the changes are quality of life edits (ex: sometimes on mobile, 2 lines of text in a header would overlap each other a bit) or simply personal preference (all of the user avatar images are now circular). More information is available in the skin's [README](https://github.com/izestforrest/Rainbow-Reversi-AO3-Site-Skins/tree/main/Reversi%20Base/README_og.md).

## How to Use a Site Skin
1. You must have an AO3 account and be logged in.
2. On your profile page (Dashboard), there is a link on your navigation bar called "Skins". This will be on the left-hand side if you are on desktop, and on mobile it will be in a box above your username and profile image.
3. This should bring you to a page titled "My Site Skins". (You can also navigate to My Work Skins, Public Site Skins, and Public Work Skins.)
4. Select "Create Site Skin". This will bring you to a form called Create New Skin. Make sure "Write Custom CSS" is selected (this should be the default).
5. You do not need to know **ANY** coding or CSS in order to use this. Just choose a title, and paste your copied code into the "CSS" textbox.
6. Select "Submit". This should bring you to a page showing your new site skin - it will all be code. Just scroll to the bottom, where you can "Use" to apply the skin, or "Preview" if you just want to see what it looks like first.
7. Selecting "Use" on any skin will apply it, and will change AO3's appearance on any device as long as you are logged in. If you need to undo this, you can "Revert to Default Skin" on any page in the Site Skins dashboard. This option is also in the footer at the bottom of the website, so you can access it from any page on AO3 by scrolling to the bottom. Reversi is also an option linked in the footer.

### About
  The goal of this project is to create Site Skins that are more accessible to users that are unfamiliar with them. I want to make skins that bring a customizable experience to AO3, but that don't interrupt the familiarity of the site's appearance. </br>
  
  For that reason, Reversi is the foundation I'm building on. It's the only official Dark Mode option AO3 has available, and AO3's Wizard for non-CSS customization is based on a strictly Light Mode palette.
