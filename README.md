# "Rainbow Reversi" - an AO3 Site Skin Project
> [!NOTE]

### About
The goal of this project is to create Site Skins that are more accessible to users that are unfamiliar with them. I want to make skins that bring a customizable experience to AO3, but that don't interrupt the familiarity of the site's appearance. </br>
For that reason, Reversi is the foundation I'm building on. It's the only official Dark Mode option AO3 has available, and AO3's Wizard for non-CSS customization is based on a strictly Light Mode palette.
