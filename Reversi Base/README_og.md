# Reversi Base

#### Palette
From original: #333, #222, #2a2a2a, #555, #232323, #5998e6, #111, #eee, #fff, #F2EFEC
Added colors: #ccc, #2e2e2e, #303030, #2b2b2b, #262626

*Note: swapped the action borders and (darker) box-shadow colors with each other. Box-shadow in main is #232323 with a border of #2a2a2a, which doesnâ€™t look good because the border is lighter than the inset shadow. Also swapped various other #000, #111, #222 with each other, or with #2a2a2a.

## Changes
At some point, I plan to have a list of all of my changes here in this README. For now, all my changes can be viewed in the code, which is separated into 5 sections:

- Base code (revisions will be marked by a comment)
- General Site fixes
- Mobile-specific fixes
- Reversi fixes
- Personalization

Each section will be in comments - `/*CSS comments look like this*/`
