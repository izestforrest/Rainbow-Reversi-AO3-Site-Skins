## Changes
At some point, I plan to have a list of all of my changes here in this README. For now, all my changes can be viewed in the code, which is separated into 5 sections:

- Base code (revisions will be marked by a comment)
- General Site fixes
- Mobile-specific fixes
- Reversi fixes
- Personalization

Each section will be in comments - `/*CSS comments look like this*/`
